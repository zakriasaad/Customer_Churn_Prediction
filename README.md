# Customer_Churn_Prediction

### Churn:
A problem for B2C companies, churn is when a customer stop buying all products and services and becomes an ex-customer. Typically, this is a negative event for the company as it reduces the businesses revenue.

### Churn prediction:
Churn prediction is one of the most popular Big Data use cases in business. It consists of detecting customers who are likely to cancel a subscription to a service.

### Customer Churn:
Customer churn is when a customer stop buying all products and services and becomes an ex-customer. Typically, this is a negative event for the company as it reduces the businesses revenue. Importantly this is done on a cohort basis, i.e., new customers added in the period are ignored in the calculation.

### Why Customer Churn Prediction Is Important
Customer churn prediction allows organizations to proactively approach at-risk clients and try to repair the relationship before the customer leaves. In effect it is a pre-warning that lets you act. It is generally accepted that retaining a customer costs a lot less than acquiring a new one. So being able to predict a customer is going to churn and preventing it, is better than losing them and finding another to replace them.

## Objectives:
Finding the most suited machine learning model for correct classification of Churn and non churn customers.

## Conclusion
#### SIX MACHINE LEARNING MODELS WERE BUILT AND TRAINED

#### RANDOM FOREST OUTPERFORMED OTHER MODELS
#### MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES ARE
    CONTRACT
    MONTHLY CHARGE
    TENURE IN MONTHS
    NUMBER OF REFERRALS
    NUMBER OF INDEPENDENTS
#### Further Working can be done in model explanation using LIME and SHAP methods that build more trust and reliability on the above used models
